This interface represents a user.
It has the some of the same fields as a Firebase User.
Note that in the default implementation, we simply take the Firebase user
and use it as a FireCMS user, so that means that even if they are not mapped
in this interface, it contains all the methods of the former, such as `delete`,
`getIdToken`, etc.
