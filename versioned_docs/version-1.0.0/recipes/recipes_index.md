In this section we will demonstrate some advanced use cases that can be solved
with the multiple features provided by FireCMS.

For example, we can build the data structure for a **blog** that you can
then render using SSR (server side rendering) with a tool like
next.js for blazing fast performance and SEO.

We will also show how to build a **role system**, that allows certain users to
perform operations in collections or not.

Another usual problem is handling **localizations**, so we show you
how to create a data structure that works both for developers and content
creators.
