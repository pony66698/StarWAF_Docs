The CPU is the central processing unit that processes instructions for the computer system. They go through the fetch-decode-execute cycle. 
The CPU consits of three parts:

Cache - Very fast memory inside the CPU and stores recent data so it can be accessed quickly for when needed. The cache is always checked first when data requests 
are seen from the CPU. If no data is present in the cache, it will check the RAM. 

### The Von Neumann architecture

Von Neumann was a computer scientist and he designed the architecture for the CPUs we use in our systems today.
The design consisted of the Program Counter, Memory Address Register, Memory Data Register and the Accumulator.

The Program Counter holds the memory address for the cycle of each instruction. 

The accumulator is where all mathmatical calculations happen and stores the results inside the arithmetic logic unit (ALU).

Memory Address Register (MAR) - holds any sort of memory address which the CPU is about to use.

The Memory Data Register (MDR) holds the actual data or instruction used by the CPU. 

The Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle

All central processing units follow this cycle to carry out instructions inside the computer. There are only three steps, fetch, decode and execute. 

Fetch - memory address is copied from PC to MAR. Instruction is then copied from MAR to MDR. PC gets ready for next cycle.

Decode - MDR is decoded by control unit and then prepares for the next step.

## Memory 

RAM stands for Random Access Memory, it can be read or writtten.
Memory can be two types - Volatile and Non-Volatile - Volatile memory requires a form of power of keep its data and Non-volatile requires no power 
ROM is read only memory and tells the CPU how to boot. This is non-volatile memory. ROM contains the instructions on how the PC should boot up, this is known
as the BIOS (Basic Input Output System).
