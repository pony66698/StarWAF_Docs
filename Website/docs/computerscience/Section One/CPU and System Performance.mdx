The CPU itself and depend on the performance of the computer. The CPU consits of clock speed, cores and cache

Clock Speed is measured in Hz and is the number of instructions a single core can carry out every second. The higher the clockspeed, the more instructions which can be carried
out. Most computers nowadays will have clockspeeds between 2Ghz and 3Ghz. The CPU I can be overclocked to make it run faster then the manufacturer of the CPU intended it to run at.
For example, the CPU can be at a factory setting of 3ghz however the consumer could overclock it to 3.5ghz. If this isn't done properly, it can cause the OS to crash and CPU to heat
up or even damage the CPU or system. To overclock, different types of cooling are usually recommended such as water cooling. 

Number of Cores - The more number of cores in the CPU means the instructions can carry out at once, this means more instructions can be carried out at once. 

Cache size - A larger cache inside the CPU allows faster access to even more data.

RAM - The amount of RAM can also affect the performance and overall make the system perform smoothly. If not much RAM is inside a computer system, it can run slowly due
to overload in the virtual memory (computers other way of storng data when RAM is full). More RAM also means more programs can be stored in it and more memory-strong 
applications will be able to perform smooth. Upgrading RAM on a desktop or even a laptop is easy, you can buy RAM sticks online and many motherboards have extra slots
for easy upgrade. RAM comes in clockspeeds of Mhz and come in different speeds e.g. 3200Mhz or 3600Mhz. RAM can also be overclocked just like a CPU to run at faster speeds
than the manufacturer intended it to run at. 

A GPU (Graphics processing unit) help process images and relieve the CPU of load. This gives the CPU the availibility to do other things. Most computers have integrated graphics
built into the CPU however they can be low performing and external GPUs are better for higher quality graphics. Using dedicated GPUs can improve performance of graphic intensive 
applications such as video games and design software such as blender.
