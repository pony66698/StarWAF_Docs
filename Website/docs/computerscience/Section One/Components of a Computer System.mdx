A computer is a machine that processes data

The purpose of a computer is to take data, process it and then output it. They consist of hardware and software that work together to process data and complete tasks. 
Hardware is the physical stuff that makes up the computer system such as the CPU or motherboard. Software is the programs and applications that a computer system runs 
for example a video game or a word processor. 


There are different types of computer systems and they range in devices from calculators and watches to supercomputers used by banks. In most cases, computers are designed
for general purpose or they may be dedicated systems meaning they are designed for one particular function.


Embedded systems are computers built into other devices, such as a washing machine.
Embedded systems are usually easier to design, this is because they are dedicated to a single task, this also makes them cheaper to produce and more efficient at doing 
their task than a general purpose computer


Components of a Computer


The power supply (PSU) - Supplies power to the motherboard, optical drive and other hardware.

Case cooling fan - extracts hot air from the PC case. 

CPU heat sink and cooling fan - This takes in heat produced by the CPU and keeps it at a steady temperature (they tend to generate alot of heat)

CPU - Sits in the motherboard and covered by the heat sink (more detail on the CPU in the next section "The CPU")

Optical Drive - For read and writing of optical disks (More detail on "Secondary Storage" section)

RAM sticks - Computer memory (More detail on "Memory" section)

Hard Disk Drive (HDD) - Internal Secondary Storage 

Motherboard - The main circuit that connects hardware together.

Graphics card - Helps process images (More on "CPU and System Performance")
