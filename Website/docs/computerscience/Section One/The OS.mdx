The OS is found on most systems and has two main functions of managing hardware and software. It also provides the user with things such as multi-tasking, a user friendly interface,
securirty, utility software (See "Uitlity Software Section") and other things such as user accounts 

## Device Drivers and the OS

Peripherals such as keyboards, mice and even GPUs require drivers to work properly with the OS. When you plug a device in, the operating system will detect the device and 
automatically install the driver for it so the operating system and the peripheral itself and communicate easily. Device manufactureres may also release updates or bux fixes for
these devices. These updates or bug fixes are either done automatically or done by the user manually. When the computer boots up, the operating system matches the right drivers with
the right devices.


## User Interfaces

The operating system of a computer provides the user with a user interface, the most commonly used on is GUI (Graphical User Interface) and is used widely over a range of devices from 
Android‚Ñ¢ and apple smartphones to Windows and MacOS. Before touchscreen, GUI was known to be WIMP based (Windows, icons, menus and pointers) however it has evolved and changed with
touch controls and haptics for smartphones aswell. 
Command line interface is another user interface but is different to GUI in many ways. It is mainly used in applications such as command prompt or terminals on Linux distributions.
The command line interface is said to be for more advanced users as its not suitable to everyday users. Its used to process automated scripts.
