## Primary and Secondary Storage

Primary storage is the storage where the CPU can access. It has quick read and write speeds. Secondary storage is storage which data such as the operating system and user files 
are stored which aren't being actively used. This is also much slower than primary storage

Some examples of secondary storage include Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid State Drives (SSDs). Hard disks have high amounts of storage and are reliable. HDDs are traditional
way internal storage. They contain metal disks which spin at high speeds and the moveable arm inside the HDD access these disks to read and write. HDDs are extremely reliable and last long. 
However, since they have moving parts, any sort of impact from dropping can damage the moving parts causing it to become unreadable by the OS. HDDs can also become fragmented 
(See Utlilties section). 

## Solid State Storage

Solid State Drives are more modern and have much faster read and write speeds and have the same purpose as HDDs. SSDs can also provide much faster boot times for the operating system
and can also be used to backup data. They are silent and shockproof and do not become fragmented. However, SSDs can only be written a certain number of times before they worsen. 

## Just to finish off...

Two other types of secondary storage worth knowing is optical disks and magnetic tapes. 
Optical Disks are dvds, Blu-Rayâ„¢ and CDs. They have low capacity and nowadays aren't used much due to streaming services such as Netflix and SpotifyÂ® which make optical disks useless. 
Modern devices such as smartphones or tablets don't use optical disks and many desktops nowadays don't have dvd loaders with them anymore. They also have slow read and write speeds. 

Magnetic Tapes can be used to archive and have greater capacities than HDDs. They are quite old now which makes them extremely cheap and usually contain things such as old movies
or videos from a long time ago. Magnetic tapes read and write data from the beginning to the end or until it is stopped. However, once the correct data has been found, the read and write speeds
are fast.
