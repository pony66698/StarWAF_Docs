Over time, HDDs can become fragmented, this is when files are moved,edited or deleted and create gaps inside the disk which cause it to slow down and perform poorly. When
writing a file to a disk, the OS also makes the gap even smaller by splitting the file. Essentially, chunks of the same file are spread everywhere on the drive and it takes
the HDD longer to fetch files. To fix this problem, we use software called defragmentation software. This type of software recognises fragmented files on a hardrive and puts
them back together. Not only does this speed up the read/write speeds of the disk, it also frees space up and helps in prevention of further fragmentation. Remember, SSDs do
not require defragmenting, they are flash drives and don't contain moving parts. However, they only have a limited amount of read/write speeds.

## Compression Software 

Compression software takes files and compresses them to make the file size smaller by temporarily or permanently removing data from them. This is done usually because many websites
have upload limits not allowing people to send files over a limit, meanining they must be compressed. They take up less space and are quicker to download. 

## Encryption Software

Encryption software encrpyts any sort of data to prevent others from accessing it eg hackers or third parties. If certain data is stolen and is encrypted, the hackers will not be 
able to access the data without the encryption key. The only person who has the key to access it is the owner of that particular data and without it its inaccessible. This creates
easy security on your files and keeps it secure even if its been stolen. Technology has evolved so much that its almost impossible for hackers to crack keys and use software to figure
them out.
