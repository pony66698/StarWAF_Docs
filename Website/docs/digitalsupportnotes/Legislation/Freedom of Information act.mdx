## Purpose

- Was introduced to give the public the right to access any information recorded by public sector organisations.

These organisations include:

- Schools
- Councils
- Government departments
- Health trusts and hospitals
- Library's
- Museums
- Anyone is able to request information regardless of how old they are, where they live or their nationality

### What does the act do?

The act allows anyone to find out what data an organisation has about them or a public
body.

### How can the public gain access to the information?

Requests must be made in writing, wither by letter or by email. The organisation then
has 20 working days to provide the information.

### What are the processes involved?

Writing to the organisation asking for your information. With also a cost.
