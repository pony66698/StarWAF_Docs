Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing

The act was set up to protect the consumer from unsolicited emails, regardless of bulk spam emails or commercial emails, from brands and businesses.

The act does make an exception for exempt transactional and relationship messages.

The act requires advertisers to:

- Clearly label messages as an ad
- Give recipients an option to opt out
- Provide a valid physical postal address

You are not allowed to provide misleading email address.
