`2.` Project scope <br />
`3.` Stakeholders <br />
`4.` Resources <br />
`5.` Budgets <br />
`6.` Project lifecycles <br />
`7.` Risks and issue management <br />
`8.` Quality management <br />

### Project aims and objectives

These are the `goals` that you set for your project. These will play a critical role in the projects success or failure. 


If you set the goals and objectives before the work begins, you, your client, and your team are on the same page. This will help to avoid misunderstandings. 

:::tip Good goals are
` - ` **Realistic**: Can we accomplish this goal with the alloted time and resources available to us? <br />
` - ` **Clear**: Do we know exactly what is being asked of us? Does everyone involved understand? <br />
` - ` **Measurable**: Are there quantifiable indicators with which we can judge each goal? <br />
:::

### Project scope

Typically written by the **Project Manager**. The `scope` outlines the entire project, including any deliverables and their features, as well as a list of stakeholders who will be affected. <br />
**This can include:** <br />
`-` User/client requirements <br />
`-` Business case <br />



:::info Justification
No project starts without a need already existing. The need is the justification. <br />
The justification will explain the need for the project, and how the end result will resolve that issue.
:::

**Examples of needs can include** <br />
` - ` A competitor as come out with a new product that currently has no market competition. <br />
` - ` Customer feedback has been asking for a new tool to include in your product.

#### Scope destination
This will help establish boundries for the project to exist. It also manages your stakeholders' expectations/input, and gives the team members some creative limitations to work within. <br />
`-` Expected outcomes <br />

#### Business objectives
Outline your business objectives by defining the targets your business hopes to achieve within this project. 

:::tip
This can include product launch goal dates, a new business modelto generate a higher rate of recurring revenue, higher customer satisfaction, increase first time buyers and others.
:::

#### Project deliverables

` - ` List out the deliverables your team members need to produce in order to meet business objectives. <br />
` - ` This can include the product itself, instruction manuals, marketing materials, press materials, etc..

#### Project exclusions

These are the boundries of the project, what we are not going to include. 

**Constraints** <br />
These are what makes managing a project such a puzzle. 

:::tip top there
The top three constraints for managing a project are typically: <br />
`1.` Time <br />
`2.` Money <br />
`3.` Scope <br />
:::

There are also additional constraints that can pop up at any time. Such as: risk, resources, organisation, mathos, customers and more. 

### Stakeholders

**What is a Stakeholder in project management?** <br />
` - ` A Stakeholder is anyone with an interest or investment in your project. 

<br />

**Types of stakeholders** <br />
Internal stakeholders <br />
External stakeholders


#### Internal stakeholders
These are people coming from inside the business. These are people such as Team members, managers, executives etc..

#### External stakeholders
These are people from outside of the business. Such as: Customers, supploers and investors. 

### Resources

A resource can be a person, a team, tool, finances and time `-` This can be a certain skill.

#### Resource planning
` - ` A process of allocating tasks to team members based on their capacity, skill sets, and the best fit for the job. <br />

`-` Timelines and deadlines

### Budget

The goal of budget management is to control project costs within cthe approved budget and deliver the expected priject goals. 

### Project lifecycles

A set of distinct high-level stages required to transform an idea of concept into reality in an orderly and efficient manner.
