## Technology considerations

To create the website, we will need a website hosting server, if the current college one cannot support this extra website on the same server, and we will need a domain for the outlet. 

## Product marketplace

The target market for these products are the college students. The catering outlet is going to the at the college, so it makes sense for it to be targeted at them.

### Marketing strategy
In order to become succesfull, the catering outlet must differentiate itself from competitors in order to appeal to customers in the college. To do this, we will utilise online web marketing tools to promote the outlet.

- Advertisements 
- Email lists 
- SEO 
- Heatmaps

#### Analytics
Website analytics helps your website in multiple different ways: <br />
1. `It helps you get to know your customers`, in this case, students. It allows you to see how they interact with your site, which leads to suggestions to how you can improve it and what they are looking for that you don't sell yet. <br />
2. You can see what product has the most interest (views), then focus that product and release different viarities of it. <br />

All these methods will help weith website `Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)`, helping your site show up first in a search engine. 

#### Advertisements
Advertisements can help increase sales by telling potential and current customers about your new product launches, special offers and improvements. Apart from reminding current customers about your business, advertising can also help to create or develop a distinctive brand for your business.

#### Email lists
An Email list is a special list of names and email addresses of people who gave you permission to send them updates via email about your business. <br />
Creating an email list is important as it allows you to tand into a users inbox. There is no ranking system, like Google which determines where you sit under a search term. It is direct and personal. <br />

#### Search Engine Optimisation
SEO, `Search Engine Optimisation` is important as it determines where you show when a customer goes to seach for your business. You don't want to be at the bottom of a search list as usually, people pick the first one they see, so it's good to get there first.

#### Heatmaps
A website heatmap tells you where your visitors are clicking on a wbesite. This can help with what they like on the website and it shows that data to you in a graphical format that is easy to understand and usually colour coded. 

## Organisation and Staffing
With large projects, there is a neeed for additional staffing within the organisation. <br />

:::tip Staffing Positions
- Staffing Position 1: Website developer
  - Someone will need to develop the website and get it online. This will be the role of the website developer. 
- Staffing Position 2: Web designer
  -  This will be the person who will create the design for the website, following instructions from the management of the outlet. 
- Staffing Position 3: Website tester
  - To ensure the security and ease of using the website, we will need a tester. This person will be the main web tester for the organisation
- Staffing Position/s 4: Marketing/Team
