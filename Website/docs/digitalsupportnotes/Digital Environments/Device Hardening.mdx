The process of security by reducing its surface of vulnerability.

` - ` Eliminating as many security risks/flaws as possible <br />
` - ` Achieved by removing all non-essential software programs and utilities <br />
` - ` Removing default settings <br />
` - ` Applying advanced configurations to restrict access <br />


<br />

Here are some ways to harden a system: <br />
1. [BIOS/UEFI](/docs/BIOS-UEFI "pageRef")
2. Built into Windows 10
3. Group policy
4. Registry


### BIOS/UEFI
` - ` Password protected <br />
` - ` Enable secure boot-UEFI only <br />
` - ` Disable ports such as front USB <br />
` - ` Enable chassis intrusion detection <br />
` - ` Install BIOS and UEFI firmware updates <br />


### Built into Windows 10

` - ` Enable passwords for all accounts <br />
` - ` Set a password with your screensaver <br />
` - ` Enforce password policies <br />
` - ` Turn on Windows Firewall <br />
` - ` Disable remote access <br />
` - ` Enable or install antivirus protection tools <br />
` - ` Enable windows updates <br />
` - ` Encrypt storage media <br />
` - ` Switch off unused services and ports <br />
` - ` Remove old device drivers/unused hardware <br />
` - ` Apply principle of least priveledge <br />
` - ` Lock down features and tools such as [gpedit.mdc](/docs/device-hardening/#group-policy "pageRef") <br />

### Group Policy
This is controlled by `gpedit.msc` <br />

` - ` Restrict access to control <br />
` - ` Block Command Prompt <br />
` - ` Prevent software installations <br />
` - ` Disable forced restarts <br />
` - ` Disable automatic driver updates <br />
` - ` Disable removable media drives <br />
` - ` Hide balloon and toast notifications <br />
` - ` Remove onedrive <br />

###  Registry
` - ` This is a set of database settings and opeions installed on all versions of windows <br />
` - ` Hives, leys, strings structire <br />
` - ` The `regedit` allows values to be changed <br />
` - ` Windows features can be enabled and disabled <br />

<br />

### SOP
It can also help to have a [Standard Operating Procedure](/docs/sop/ "pageRef")
