The fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP)

IP v4 addresses use the format **`xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`** <br />
Four sets of three digits ranging between 0-255 separated by a full stop. The number 0 and 255 are not usually used for IP addresses.
Each set of digits is called an `octet` <br />

Typically, addresses appear as: <br />
`192.168.1.1`  -  IP Address <br />
`255.255.255.0`  -  Subnet Mask <br />

Part of the IP address relates to a network address and part to a node address. (Submet mask)

**IP Address Classes**

The first octet of an IP address specifies which class an address belongs to. 

For each class of addresses a default subnet mask exists.
