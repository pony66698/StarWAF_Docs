You can get different types of ethernet cables.

### Cable Types

- Coaxial Cable  
- Twisted Pair  
    - Catgory 3 ‚Äì Three twists per inch 
    - Cat 5 ‚Äì five twists per inch 
    - Cat 5e ‚Äì 5 twists per square inch; pairs also twisted together 
    - Cat 6 ‚Äì Six twist per inch, with improved insulation 
    - RJ45 connector is used to connect the device.  
- Fibre Optic 

### Characteristics: 

- Routing IP packets 
- Quality of Service classification 
- Virtual LAN configurations 
- Cheap 


Data collisions can occur is two devices send at the same time especially if a hub is used.  


CSMA/CD protects against this 

 

### CSMA/CD 

`Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection`


If data collision occurs senders back off and resend. It uses carrier-sensing to defer transmissions until no other stations are transmitting
