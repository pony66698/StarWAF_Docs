Cloud computing is the delivery of IT resources when needed over the internet. Example: *Google Cloud*

Cloud computing is a method by which remote servers are used to store files and run applications, rather than storing them locally. 


Cloud computing uses `virtualisation` which one physical server hosts virtually many cloud servers.


This is handles behind the scenes and the end user never realises this.

### Advantages and Disadvantages
