### Characteristics
- Flexibility
    - Hybrid cloud setup uses traditional systems as well as the latest cloud technology.

    - Organisations own and operate the data centres
- Compliance
    - Must follow restrictions on where data can reside, and this often means they cannot move certain workloads to the public cloud
