It's a form of public cloud with more security and scalability would be less of an option. Community cloud is a multi-Tennant platform

### Characteristics

    - The whole cloud is shared between several organisations or a community
- Security
    - More secure than public cloud but less secure than private cloud
- Sharing infrastructure
    - Allows us to share resources
