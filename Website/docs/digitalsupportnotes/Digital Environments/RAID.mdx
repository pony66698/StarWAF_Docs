Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks **Or** Redundant Array of Independent Disks 

The utilisation of multiple hard drives as to provide data redundancy and improvments in performance. <br />

Combines multiple physical disk components into one or more logical units for the purpose of data redundancy, performance improvement or both.  

<br />

RAID exists as many different levels. Each one providing benefits dependent on hardware setup, e.g. <br />
- RAID 0
- RAID 1
- RAID 5
- RAID 10

:::tip Hardware or software?
RAID can be implemented as hardware or as software. <br />
Both setups still require multiple hard drives <br />
Hardware RAID requires a built in RAID controller card, whereas software RAID requires an operating system or utility that provides the RAID functionality

### RAID 0
- Often referred to as `striping`
- Uses two drives in conjunction with one other for speed
- Data is divided when it is written to both drives so that the workload is balanced, leading to it being more efficient
- There is no redundancy in this method
- Two identical drives should be used - Two different drives can be used, but at a cost. 
    - For example: If you have an 80GB and a 120GB drive, RAID 0 will have the machine treat them as two 80GB drives, ignoring the extra 40GB of space.
- A minimum of two drives are needed

RAID 0 is ideal for non-critical storage of data that have to be read/written to at high speed, such as on an image retouching or video editing station

#### Advantages
- Great performance, both in read and write operations
- Easy to implement 

#### Disadvantages
- If one drive fails, all data in the RAID 0 array are lost

### RAID 1
- Often referred to as `mirroring`
- Essentially a failsafe set up for a hard drive
- Two drives are set up so in effect all data is written twice
- If one drive fails, all data is preserved on drive two and the system will remain up and running
- Minimum of two drives are needed
- Two 100GB drives will mean you have 100GB of storage only
- Ideal for mission citical storage, example: Accounting systems

#### Advantages
- Excellent read speed and a write-speed that is comarable to that of a single drive
- If a drive fails, data does not have to be rebuilt, they just have to be copied to the replacment drive
- RAID 1 is very simple

#### Disadvantages
- Effective storage capacity is only half the total drive
- Does not always allow for hot swap

### RAID 5
- This combines RAID 0 & RAID 1, however it does not use mirroring. 
- A parity block accross all drives is employed
- If a drive fails the parity, infomation along with the remaining drive information can be used to rebuild the set
- A minimum of 3 drives is required for RAID 5

RAID 5 combines efficient storage with excellent security and decent performance <br />
Ideal for fiel and application servers that have a limited number of data drives

#### Advantages
- Read data transactions are very fast while write data transactions are somewhat slower
- If a drive fails, you still have access to all data, eben while the failed drive is being replaces and the storage controller rebuilds the data on the new drive

#### Disadvantages
- Drive failures have an effect on throughput, although this is still acceptable
- Complex

### RAID 10
- Combines the advantages (and disadvantages) of RAID 0 and RAID 1 into a single system. 
- It prvides security by mirroring all data on secondary drives, while using stripping across each set of drives to speed up data transfers
- Requires a minimum of 4 drives

#### Advantages
- If somethign goes wrong with one disk, in a RAID 10 configuration, the rebuild time is very fast as all that is needed is to copy all data from the surviving mirror to the new drive
    - This can take as little as 30 minutes for 1TB of data

#### Disadvantages
- Half of the storage capacity goes to mirroring, so it's an expensive way to have redundancy
