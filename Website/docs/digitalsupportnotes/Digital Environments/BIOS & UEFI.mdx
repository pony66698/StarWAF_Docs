The BIOS and the UEFI are different. The difference is...

### UEFI vs BIOS
- UEFI has more graphical and interactive look compared to BIOS. UEFI stores all data about initialisation and startup
- UEFI has faster boot times
- UEFI supports secure boot, which secures the device from booting from unauthorised applications
- UEFI runs in 32bit or 64bit mode, whereas BIOS runs in 16bit mode
- BIOS based systems use MBR partitions, while UEFI ones use GPT ones
- On a GPT disk, you can use more than four partitions on each disk
- GPT is also required for disks larger than 2 TB
