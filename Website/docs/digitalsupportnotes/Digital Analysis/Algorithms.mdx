A process or set of clearly defined rules followed to support calculations or problem solving.

## Characteristics
 
`Finiteness` - Finite number of steps <br />
`Unambiguous` - Steps must be clear and lead to one meaning <br />
`â€¢` Clearly defined inputs and outputs <br />
`â€¢` Logical sequencing of steps <br />
`â€¢` Iteration - repetition of steps until results achieved <br />
`â€¢` Selection - input leading to choice of step <br />
`â€¢` Structured English

## Application
When can this be used? <br />


`â€¢` Automate calculations to improve efficiency of a process  <br />
`â€¢` Design a step by step solution to solve a problem  <br />
`â€¢` Supports machine learning for data analysis  <br />
