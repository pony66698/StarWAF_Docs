How is data stored?

### On premises

#### Hard Drives

- SSD
- HDD
    - Storing on a single HDD or SSD can be risky
    - No backup
    - You have to have the drive with you at all times to use it

#### Portable storage devices

- Flash drive
- CD
- DVD
- Portable SSD
- SD card
    - You have to take it around with you
    - Not ideal for a large business who collaborate

#### File servers

- NAS
    - Can be accessed by anyone on a network
    - Easily accessible
    - Connects through a network, instead of directly into a computer
    - If power supply fails, no access.
- SAN
    - Storage area network
    - Used in enterprises (expensive)
    - High speed, low latecy
    - If a single disc fails, the SAN continues
    - Robust
    - Appears as a single drive
    - Linked using fibre optics
    - Block based storage
        - A physical record
