import { ReferenceLink } from '@site/docs/components/_nanos.mdx';

A database model conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their relationships.

Tries to overcome the [hierarchical data model](/docs/hdm/). 

Child node can link to many different parents

Parent nodes are called owners and child nodes are called members

Does support M : M

### Pros

- Capability to handle more relationship types - Can handle the one to many and many to many relationship
- Ease of access data - The data access is easier and flexible than the hierarchical model - Because of the multiple connections, more ways to access data
- Data integrity - The network model does not allow a member to exist without an owner
- Conceptually easy to design

### Cons

- System complexity - All the records are maintained using pointers and hence the whole database structure becomes very complex
- Structure is not user friendly.
