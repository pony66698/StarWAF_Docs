Access control is a selective restriction of access to data. <br />

Access controls are a way of identifying someone is who they say they are are and what information or data they are allowed to access and use within a company setting. <br />

` - ` A security approach that governs who has access to, and can make use of certain resources <br />
` - ` It also assists a business to reduce risk when it comes to handling sensitive data <br />

Access controls can determine which services a user can access, such as: <br />
` - ` Email <br />
` - ` Software <br />
` - ` Internet <br />
` - ` Documents <br />
` - ` Admin access <br />

Explanation of each control measure: 

### Physical Access
You need something physical to get in. Physical protection systems are used to limit, or allow access to a specific area or strucure <br />

#### Pros
` - ` Need something physical to get in, no risk of writing passwords down

#### Cons
` - ` Could get stolen

:::tip Examples
` - ` Biometrics (FaceID, Fingerprint) <br />
` - ` Locks (Keys, RFID cards) <br />
` - ` Doors <br />
:::

### Remote access

Remote access control monitors and controls access to a computer or network anywhere and anytime. 

#### Pros
` - ` Allows you to work from anywhere and pick up where you left off

#### Cons
` - ` Though hard to do so, connection could get intercepted eventually

:::tip Examples
` - ` VPN - **Virtual Private Network** - It allows people who work remotely, from home, to router their traffic securely through an online server that connects them to their company's network. <br />
` - ` VCN - **Virtual Computer Network** - Allows screen sharing to view and control the desktop of another comuter. This is usually carried out by using a VCN <br />
` - ` RDP - **Remote Desktop Protocol** - A Microsoft protocol used to achieve a remote connection, but there are also versions for other operating systems <br />
` - ` Internet Proxy Server - This provides a connection outside of a network or firewall. This is helpful when it comes to creating external connections <br />

### Permissions
These are a set of rules that determine who has access to what parts of the system. <br />

Permissios allow you to establish positions in your network, assign them to specific indiciduals or groups to allow them to do or view certain things <br />

#### Pros
` - ` People are only able to do what they need to do. No risk of them doing something unauthourised

#### Cons
` - ` Someone must set it up, and that can be time consuming if there are many people

:::tip Examples
` - ` Write <br />
` - ` Read <br />
` - ` Edit <br />
` - `  Delete <br />

### Authentication
This is a process where a system verifies te identity of a user who wishes to access the system, confirming that someone is who they claim to be <br />

The simplest form of this is the username and password method. This is a poor method. Stronger methods are required, and that is called `Multi-Factor Authentication` <br />

#### Pros
` - ` Added level of security

#### Cons
` - ` Time consuming and frustraiting <br />
` - ` The authentication method (phone, token) could be lost or stolen

:::tip Examples
` - ` 2FA <br />
` - ` Capcha <br />
