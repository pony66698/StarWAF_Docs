Also known as `HDM`

### Pros:

- Data can be retrieved easily due to the explicit links between the table structure
- Referential integrity is always maintained. i.e. any changes made in the parent table are automatically updated in a child table
- Promotes data sharing
- It is conceptually simple due to the parent-child relationship
- Database security is enforced
- Quick access at root nodes
- Efficient with 1:N relationships
- A clear chain of command or authority
- Increases specialisation
- Clean results
- High performance

### Cons:

- If the parent table and child table are unrelated, the adding a new entry in the child take is difficult because additional entry must be added in the parent table
- Complex relationships are not supported
- Redundancy which results in inaccurate information
- Change in structure leads to change in all application programs
- M :N relationships are not supported
- No data manipulation or data definition language
- Lack of standards
- Poor flexibility
- Difficult to implement into a database
- Communication barriers
- Organisational [disunity](https://oldnotes.nayanpatel.net/Disunity-da0f6325f61c498ba15ca2077eb85d8e)
- Rigid structure
