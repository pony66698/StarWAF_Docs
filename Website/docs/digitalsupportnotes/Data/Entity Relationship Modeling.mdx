import { ReferenceLink } from '@site/docs/components/_nanos.mdx';

A type of diagram that lets you see how different entities (e.g. people, customers, or other objects) relate to each other in an application or a database.

It's used to represent the data given scenario. Entity relationship models have 3 components: <br />
` - ` Entities <br />
` - ` Attributes <br />
` - ` Relationships <br />

### Entity
An entity is something on the real world that can be represented in the system. These could be: Books, People, A bag

Each entity is represented by a rectangular box with its name written inside it. <br />
The information held on an entity is the set of characteristics that define the entity. These are known as `attributes` <br />

## The degree of a relationship
### 1:1
One to One <br />
This is when something is directly linking to something else.

#### Example

### 1:M
One to Many <br />
When something is linking to multiple other things <br />

#### Example
![](/img/1tom.png)


### M:M
Many to Many <br />
This is where many things link with many things <br />

#### Example:
