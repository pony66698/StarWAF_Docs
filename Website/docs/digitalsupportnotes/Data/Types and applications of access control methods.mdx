## Access control methods

### RBAC
**Role based access control** <br />
This works by restricting system access to only authorised users
It's an approach to implement mandatory access control or discretionary access control <br />
It could be used to allow access to certain folders within a workspace <br />

#### Pros
Allows you to create hierarchies, where managers automatically get all the permissions of their direct report

#### Cons
In the event of role explosion, translating user requirements to roles can be complicated 

### ABAC
**Attribute-based access control** <br />
An authorisation model that evaluates attributes or characteristics, rather than roles, to determine access

#### Pros
Administrators have the luxury of choosing from a large set of attributes, which helps them formulate highly specific rules

#### Cons
Can be hard to implement, especially in time-constrained situations. 

### MAC
**Mandatory access control**  <br />
A method of limiting access to resources based on the sensitivity of the information that the resource contains 

#### Pros

High level data protection <br />
Centralised information 

#### Cons
Careful Setting-Up Process `-` MAC must be set up with good care otherwise it will make working chaotic. 


### DAC
**Discretionary access control** <br />
Restricting access to objects based on the identity of the subject (the user or the group to which the user belongs) 

#### Pros
Easy to maintain
