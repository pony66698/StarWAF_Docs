API stands for `Application Programming Interface`. It allows two applications to talk to each other. <br />

APIs are needed to help applications better communicate with each other and make tasks for us simpler to understand. It also helps with productivity. <br />

Across the internet, many websites and apps can integrate with third-party providers and this is achieved by using an Application Programming Interface.  <br />

APIs make sharing knowledge on the internet simpler for companies and communities. They are used by Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and other websites to connect their services. - APIs are not visible to the end user <br />



## Examples
Some common API examples include: <br />
` - ` Paying using your phone <br />
` - ` Google maps <br />
` - ` E-commerce <br />
` - ` Weather snippets <br />
` - ` Login using Google, Twitter, Facebook etc <br />
` - ` Holiday planning site <br />

## Types

### Open APIs

Also known as Public APIs <br />
Developers can openly use Open APIs <br />
They may require registration or an API key, or they may be free. - In order to gain access to data or facilieies, they focus on external users. <br />

### Partner APIs

Not accessible to the general public and need special authorisation <br />
These are most visible and they are used to interact outside a comapny's borders <br />

### Internal APIs

Also known as private APIs <br />
Accessible by only internal systems and are shielded from external users <br />

### Composite APIs

These combine multiple data or service APIs into one <br />
Developers may us hem to make a single call to multiple endpoints <br />

## Protocols

When an API makes a call, a protocol defines the rules. It defines the data types and commands that are appropriate <br />

### REST <br />
Representational State Transfer <br />
This is a web services API <br />
Modern web applications such as Netflix, Uber, Amazon and other depend heavily on REST APIs <br />

### SOAP <br />
Simple Object Access Protocol <br />
This is a well known protocol, that is also a web API <br />
SOAP was the first protocol to standardise how applications could handle resources over network connections <br />

### RPC <br />
Remote Procedural Call <br />
This was the earliest and most basic in APIs <br />
It's aim was to allow a client to run code on a server <br />
