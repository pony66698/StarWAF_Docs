- Spreadsheet: .xlsx, .numbers, .ods, .csv, .tsv

- Images: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .bmp, .tiff, .svg

- Sound: .mp3, .wav, .ogg, .wma

- Video: .mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv

- Compress: .zip, .rar, .7zip, .gz, .tar

**We have different file formats because:**

- Standards
- File size
- Compatibility
- Quality
- Editing

**Compression:**

- Lossy
    - Loose quality, file size smaller
- Lossless
    - Keep quality, file size a little smaller

**PNG vs JPG**

PNG will be the same after compression, it is lossless compression. 

JPG quality is lower than PNG, it is lossy compression.

### File structures

**File based structure** (flat files)
Data grouped based on a type of file. <br />
One file, that stores data in a logical format. 

:::tip Example
Spreadsheet
:::

### Directory Based Structure

Data in files within separate organised folders. Structure tends to be hierarchical. 

### Realational database models

Organised data in tables, which are linked together. Data is a particular scenario. 

<br />

**Advantages** <br />
` - ` Flexible in handline data <br />
` - ` Organised data in separate tables <br />
` - ` Simpler compared to other models <br />
` - ` Easy to back up data <br />

**Disadvantages** <br />
` - ` Initial setup costs are expensive <br />
` - ` Can get slow peformance, depending on data stored <br />
` - ` Can be complex to store large amounts of data <br />

### Flat files vs Relational database structure

**Disadvantages** <br />
` - ` Flat files are less secure <br />
` - ` Flat files can get data entry errors <br />
` - ` Flat files have repeated data, causing confusion and update errors <br />
` - ` Difficult to update <br />

**Advantages** <br />
` - ` Flat files are easy to manage, due to one file <br />
` - ` Flat files require less hardware/software <br />
` - ` Easier to unserstand and setup <br />
