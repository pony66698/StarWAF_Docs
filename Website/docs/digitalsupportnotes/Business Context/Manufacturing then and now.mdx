Having watched both videos, can you identify how the process of car manufacturing has changed, explaining how the changes have affected the business, for example; the employees, financially both Capital expenditure (CapEx) and Operational expenditure (OPEx)

The old car assembly has lots of people on the work force, also in dangerous environments. <br />
The new assembly system has tobots and autonomous ways to build and put togeher cars. This means that they are making money not having employees, but robots. are expensive.

## Eco Friendly
**Then:** When cars first began to be mass manufactured, there was almost no knowledge or care given to the potential impacts of manufacturing and emmissions on the environment. 
**Now:** More and more car manufacturers are more concerned with their impact on the environment, and have subsequently introduced new manufacturing methods to reduce both emmisios from their factories, and the card themselves. 

### New manufacturing methods
- Machines more efficient and use less power
- Recycle left over material
- LED lights are more efficient
