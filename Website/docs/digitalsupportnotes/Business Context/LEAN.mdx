LEAN manufacturing, the manufacturing method that [@toyota](/docs/Toyota) uses.

## Lean Manufacturing
Lean manufacturing is a production process based on an ideology of maxamising productivity while simultaneously minimising waste within a manufacturing operation. <br />
The LEAN principle sees waste as anything that doesn't add value that the customers are willing to pay for.

### Benefits
- Reduced lead times and operting costs
- Improved product quality

### Ways to do it
- **Eliminate waste**: Waste is a negative factor for cost, deeadliness and resources. It also provides no value or services. 
- **Improve quality**: Improved quality allows companies to stay competitive and meet the changing needs and the wants of customers. 
- **Reducing costs**: Over production or having more materials than is required creates storage costs, which can be reduced through better processes and materials management. 
- **Reducing time**: Wasting time with inefficient practices is a waste of money too, while more efficient practices create shorter lead times and allow for goods and services to be delivered faster.

An example of a business that uses LEAN manufacturing is Toyota

## LEAN at a non manufacturing business

Lean would work just as well at a non manufacturing business, as the waste in most organisations is high, therefore there is more of an oppourtunity for LEAN to take effect.
