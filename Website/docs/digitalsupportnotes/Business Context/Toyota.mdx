Toyota believes that waste is anything that doesn't add to what the end user would pay for. 

The seven wastes are:
1. Over production
2. Waiting
3. Transporting
4. Inappropriate processing
5. Unnecessary inventory
6. Unnecessary / Excess Motion
6. Defects

Toyota production system is based on two concepts:

:::tip Jidoka
A Japanese term that can be translated as "automation with human touch". It is a method for quickly identifying and correcting any issues that could lead to faulty production.
:::

:::tip Just in time
Refining and coordinating each production process in the sequence.
:::

<br />

By applyingthe concepts, Toyota can produce vehicles quickly and efficiently. Especially, making what is needed when its needed.
