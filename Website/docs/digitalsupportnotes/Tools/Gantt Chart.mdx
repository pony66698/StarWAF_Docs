A Gantt chart is a horizontal bar chart used in project management to visually represent a project plan over time as well as whoâ€™s responsibleâ€”for each task in the project.
- How a project breaks down into tasks
- When each task will begin and end
- How long each task will take
- Whoâ€™s assigned to each task
- How tasks relate to and depend on each other
- When important meetings, approvals, or deadlines need to happen
- How work is progressing in a project
- The full project schedule from start to finish
