Remote support software allows IT technicians to access another device remotely to provide support


` - ` The remote connection allows the technician to see the screen of the remote device on their own screen in real-time. <br />
    ` - ` In most cases they'll be able to take control of the remote device to troubleshoot issues and perform other tasks. <br />
` - ` Remote support leverages remote access (or remote desktop) software to give the technician instant access to the remote device from anywhere, at any time. <br />
    ` - ` This means that they can provide remote assistance without having to travel to the device. <br />
` - ` While in a remote session, the technician can take control of the device and perform whatever task is needed. They can install updates, resolve issues, and perform maintenance. <br />

` - ` **Most** remote support solutions come equipped additional features that help IT pros be more productive while providing remote support. <br />

## Examples
`-` File transfer <br />
`-` Remote print <br />
`-` Chat <br />
`-` Session recording <br />
`-` Screen sharing <br />
and more... <br />

<br />

`-` By being able to remotely access a device to provide support, IT support teams, help desks, and managed service providers can resolve support tickets quicker. <br />
`-` This means they can save time and get more done throughout the day. <br />
`-` End-users receiving support enjoy faster service which leads to increased satisfaction. <br />


**Remote support can be sorted into two categories** <br />
`Unattended` and `Attended`. The difference is if the end user is present. 

### Unattended remote support

`-` Unattended access means the technician can remotely connect to the endpoint device even without an end-user present. <br />
`-` Remote support platforms make this possible by having the IT team deploy an agent app on all the computers they manage.  <br />
`-` Once the agent is installed, a member of the IT team can to connect to the remote computer they want to access. <br />
`-` By having the agent installed on the remote computer, IT technicians are able to remotely access the computers at any time, with or without someone actively using the computer.  <br />
`-` This makes it possible to support computers outside of regular office hours or when the endpoint is not in use.  <br />


### Attended remote support

`-` Also known as on-demand support, or ad-hoc support, attended support allows technicians to access a device the moment the end-user requests assistance. Once connected, the technician can provide support to resolve the issue. <br />
`-` Unlike with unattended access, there is not prior setup necessary for attended access. Because an end-user is present, they are able to help the technician establish a remote connection to their device.  <br />
`-` This can be done a variety of ways, but a common method is to have the end-user run the remote support tool‚Äôs app to generate a unique session code, which the user gives to the technician so they can connect to the device and take control. <br />
`-` Attended access enables help desk professionals to provide support to any device as long as the end-user is present. This means they can remotely support managed devices as well as personal devices. <br />
