**Fault Identification** <br />

` - ` System Alerts <br />
` - ` Activity / error <br />
` - ` Live traces <br />
` - ` Dashboards <br />

## System Alerts
This alerts the user to the problem. If a tool creates multiple alerts about the same problem, it automatically correlates them and combines them into one alert before sending it. <br />
When a fault is detected, an administrator is notified using an alarm or alert. <br />

Alerts correspond to notifying the appropriate person to deal with the event. 

## Activity / Error ligs
Event Viewer is a tool in Windows that displays detailed information about significant events on your computer  <br />
Examples of these are programs that don't start as expected, or automatically downloaded updates <br />
Event Viewer is especially useful for troubleshooting Windows and application errors <br />

**Event Viewer displays these types of events** <br />
` - ` Error <br />
` - ` Warning <br />
` - ` Information <br />
` - ` Success Audit <br />
` - ` Failure Audit <br />
` - ` The event log <br />

### Error
A significant problem, such as loss of data or loss of functionality. For example, if a service fails to load during start-up, an error will be logged.

### Warning
An event that is not necessarily significant, but may indicate a possible future problem. For example, when disk space is low, a warning will be logged.

### Information
An event that describes the successful operation of an application, driver, or service. For example, when a network driver loads successfully, an Information event will be logged.

### Success Audit
An audited security access attempt that succeeds. For example, a user's successful attempt to log on to the system will be logged as a Success Audit event.

### Failure Audit
An audited security access attempt that fails. For example, if a user tries to access a network drive and fails, the attempt will be logged as a Failure Audit event.

### The event log
Starts automatically when you start Windows. Application and System logs can be viewed by all users, but Security logs are accessible only to administrators.

## Live traces
Live traces trace the network, such as applications like `angryIP scanner`

## Dashboards
A consolidated visual representation of system condition & performance
